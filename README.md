# Swift-Testing
Learning how to code in swift through coding games
The game is a driving game similar to Tiny Wings where a platform is generated in the shape of a Sin function that the player drives on
NOTE: Almost all of my coding is done in the Drivescene.swift file contained in the Drivescene folder
